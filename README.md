# SingleRotorUAV

This repository contains the source code for my master thesis project in control and automation. The master thesis aims to provide a hardware platform that can be used to mimic the concept of reusable rockets, in a safe environment. A custom hardware platform has been developed, using the mono-copter principle of flight.

The code is seperated into three parts; the flight controller, the ground station and the MATLAB Simulink simulation.
